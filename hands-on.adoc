This is the documentation for https://github.com/nextflow-io/hack17/issues/2[Project 2^] of the Nexflow Hackaton 2017. This project will cover the implementation of a Variant Calling analisys pipeline for RNAseq data based on GATK best practices and using Nextflow as the pipeline framework.

It is supposed to be a tutorial project for newbie Nextflow users who are interested in learning how to assemble a real world genomic pipeline with Nextflow, manage dependencies by using container technologies (Docker & Singularity) and deploy the pipeline execution in a reproducible manner to the AWS cloud.
